## High Fidelity Prototype

This prototype consists of three major tasks. The tasks are as follows: learn about what a chord is, understand how much progress you have made, and try to search a different reference song. The tasks are meant to capture the main tasks that a user already part of the system (done with account setup and having tried a bit of the application) would do. These tasks would hopefully show what separates this application from the music theory learning websites already out there and how it would improve upon them. This prototype went through changes after performing a cognitive walkthrough.

The key insights from this cognitive walkthrough is that the initial prototype was not interactive enough. Objects that seemed clickable were not obvious enough to the user and that made it difficult to complete the tasks. Regarding the task of learning about chords, the user also expressed wanting to be able to see that on the music sheet itself. These changes were all reflected in the improved prototype.

### Conclusion

The things that seem obvious when creating a prototype is not that obvious to people who don't think exactly the same as me. When I created the first prototype, I did an impression test with classmates, cognitive walkthrough with multiple people, and I realized that it is important to make things obvious. When the design is flat and unassuming, the tasks become extremely difficult and hard to get through. I hope that in the future, I can improve upon this prototype in terms of contrast and making the music sheet aspect of it more seamless. There are parts of this design that still feel awkward like clicking on a chord on the music sheet or the fact that the achievements are scrollable.
