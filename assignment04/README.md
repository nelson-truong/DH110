## Why do we need UX storytelling?

In the process of designing anything, we have to ask who we are designing it for. To develop a clear idea of who the target user is and how we will accomodate for them, we need to use UX storytelling. With compelling storyboards and personas, we can pinpoint our target user and the features that we will create to take care of their issues and provide an excellent user experience.

### Maria's Scenario

#### Context

Maria has grown up listening to music since she was a child. Now that she is going to college and pursuing a degree, she has had trouble deciding what she wants to do as a career. She has been trying all kinds of hobbies and fields to try and figure out what she is passionate about. Now that she has decided to try and learn music theory, she does not want to waste her time if it does not interest her. She is tired of lectures and reading textbooks in school, she needs to know if making and understanding music as a job is what she wants. It is important to her that learning the most basic building block, music theory, is fun and if it can be as engaging and challenging as she thinks it is. She wants to understand music that matters to her, not just classical music, and also keep track of that progress to know that she is not just wasting her time.

#### Use case

After classes are over, Maria goes home and wants to continue learning music theory. She opens up the website and she has already been logged in since the last time she visited. Her home page is left off from her last music theory topic which was chords. There is a button labeled "Reference song" that she clicks. It opens up a search bar where she can start typing the song to reference. She types in "Justin Bieber", the results file in on the screen, she clicks the first result saying "Love Yourself by Justin Bieber". Back to the home page, the lesson starts off with a complete sheet music using the reference song. There are lyrics as well as notes and she can easily see the chords highlighted. There is a play button icon, that if she clicks will go through the whole song, highlighting different notes and chords as it continues, and playing the music in her ear. If she clicks the chords, a little reference pops up with what chord it is and the music theory behind chords. The page also includes an exercise at the bottom if she feels as though she has learned enough.

### Ben's Scenario

#### Context

Ben has been a woodworker his whole life and has focused on his craft for decades. Recently, he feels like he has been lacking inspiration and wants to pick up the piano as a hobby. He hopes that learning the piano can help take his mind off of work and maybe help him spend more time with his family. Ben feels more comfortable understanding things from the ground up and taking a more exploratory approach. It bothers him when he doesn't understand something and it will nag him at the back of his mind. Since he has to work his job and take care of his kids, he likes to feel like he doesn't have to make a strong time commitment. Despite that, he wants to be able to sit down and spend hours with the piano and improving his skills.

#### Use case

Ben drives home after work and remembers that his wife is picking up the kids today. He takes out his piano and opens up the website at the same time. He clicks the "reference song" button and chooses the song he has been learning. He clicks the small microphone icon, and starts recording what he has learned so far. He clicks the "comparison button" and compares his recording with what the official track sounds like. He notices that there are some discrepancies with his recording. He clicks the little notes to remember what they are, some rests on the sheet music to figure out how long he was supposed to, the time signature to understand the tempo, and the chords that he is supposed to be playing. His kids are back and he has to make dinner for them so he closes the website. Once he is done cooking and eating, he opens the website again and starts off exactly where he left it.
