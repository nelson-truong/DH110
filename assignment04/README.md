## Why do we need UX storytelling?

In the process of designing anything, we have to ask who we are designing it for. To develop a clear idea of who the target user is and how we will accomodate for them, we need to use UX storytelling. With compelling storyboards and personas, we can pinpoint our target user and the features that we will create to take care of their issues and provide an excellent user experience.
