# MusicXP - Music Theory That is Engaging and Rewarding

_Nelson Truong_

This project was all about creating an application with the user experience in mind and letting that guide the design process. By creating a meaningful and relevant user experience, I was hoping to grow as a designer but also learn important skills for the design or creation of any product. This particular project happens to be focused on the concept of music learning and I wanted this proposed application to allow folks to gain a foundation of music theory so that they can start learning how to play musical instruments. The goal was to make this application engaging and rewarding because many of the websites that are out there do not have that level of incentive or user engagement. 

## Design Statement

How do we teach music theory to anybody and everybody in a way that is engaging and familiar to them? The issue is that people, who do not know any music theory, are not used to thinking about music through a theoretical lens. The importance lies in teaching music theory through what people already know, the songs that they listen to all the time, and using audio or visual cues to help facilitate that. By creating that engaging experience, we can supplement that with incentives and inform users on their progress so that they feel a sense of accomplishment on their musical journey.

## Competitor Analysis

The design process started off with competitor analysis through heuristic evaluation and usability testing. By examining websites such as [musictheory.net](https://www.musictheory.net/) and [teoria.com](https://www.teoria.com/), I was able to glean insights on how to improve upon these websites and the direction that I wanted to take the project.

### Heuristic Evaluation

I performed this heuristic evaluation on both websites by looking at the ten usability heuristics by Jakob Nielsen. By rating each usability heuristic from 0 to 3 (0 being perfect and 3 being a severe issue), I was able to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each website as well as their commonalities and differences. I noticed that both websites were very minimalistic and both had a very low severity rating on the usability heuristic of aesthetic and minimalistic design. However, both websites also required users to memorize and process lots of information causing them to score worse on the heuristic of recognition rather than recall. I think that, often times, there is a tradeoff that websites are doing when looking at their designs. Instead of opting for a holistic approach of doing well on all heuristics, these websites are choosing to lean towards one direction and forgoing another. 

### Usability Testing

This usability test was done on musictheory.net and the user was prompted to go through a lesson, an exercise, and to use a tool on the website. I was hoping this usability test would identify some problems that I had not noticed before. Through this usability test, I realized that the website was only minimalistic and efficient for an **experienced user**. The user struggled to gain an understanding of the different parts of the website because of the ambiguity in the icons and what they represented from page to page. There was a heavy reliance on **recall** instead of recognition.

## User Research

This part of the design process focused on the formation of the research goal and target users. The user research was based upon the idea that users need **confidence** and **determination** if they want to learn music theory. The design challenge followed from that with the question: How do we teach music theory to anybody in a way that is engaging to them? By keeping the learning process engaging, we want to build confidence and keep users eager to learn more. Then I started to narrow down on the mainstream user, someone who might not be spending all their time on learning music theory. A person that is not fully focused on learning and needs the flexibility to dip in and out of the learning process. Then, I used contextual inquiry to pick at the brain of someone who also plays and learns music as a hobby. Through this, I learned that for this person, learning music was a very **fluid and organic process**. While they were trying to play the music, they were also learning the chords at the same time. I learned that combining the feeling of playing and listening to music, which is what people learn music theory to do, was key to creating an engaging experience for the user.

## UX Storytelling

Through UX storytelling we can answer the question of who we are designing for. In this part of the design process, I created two personas that I wanted to design for, Maria Gonzalez and Ben Wayne. With each persona, I created a scenario in which they were using the application. By giving context to the scenario and fleshing out the background for each persona, I was able to better understand what features I wanted to implement so that I could design for the needs of each persona.

## Low Fidelity Prototype

The creation of the low fidelity prototype came in stages. First, I started with the wireframes. To create these wireframes, I opted for the use of Figma and I tried to hone in on the idea of **information**. What information did I want the user to see and use on each frame? I tried to not care about the graphical elements such as the font size, font type, or button shapes. I wanted to leave those elements for after I had feedback on the wireframes so that I could improve on the prototype again before I spent time on the actual interface design. I presented the low fidelity prototype to a user and had them perform three different tasks. From these tasks, I was able to understand what information I should tweak or where I needed to provide more information so that the user could understand what they needed to do.

## Interface Design

After the low fidelity prototyping, I spent time on interface design. This process involved deciding on the layout of the frame, the type of font and the size in different circumstances, the shape of each element on the wireframe, and the color of each element as well. Whilst deciding these things, I also kept in mind accessibility in terms of the size of the font, the shapes of the icons, and contrast in color. Although I did not do an impression test for this at the time, I did end up doing one in the early stages of my high fidelity prototype. Overall, people enjoyed the color scheme that I had chosen and the graphical elements, but they still struggled to understand what certain parts were supposed to mean or do. I tackled this idea later on in my high fidelity prototype.

The high fidelity prototype was a culmination of everything that I had been working on throughout the project. By creating a working prototype on Figma, I was able to conduct a cognitive walkthrough with a select user. I provided them three different tasks and collected feedback as they attempted each one. From that feedback, I was able to further improve on my prototype and finalize it into the following prototype and digitized wireflow.

</p>

Through the creation of this prototype, I learned what it meant to make something **interactable** and more importantly, to convey that interaction to the user. It was not easy designing interactive buttons or creating an interactive process, but the cognitive walkthrough helped immensely in identifying the weakpoints of my previous prototype.

## Evaluation and Revisions

Overall, I was happy with how the final prototype turned out. The design process of creating buttons, scrollable elements, and an interactive music sheet made the whole process extremely fun. However, there are still some parts to it that need further refinement. I think the progress bar could use a lot of work because it is not quite clear what seventy percent or fifty percent is, both in terms of graphics and significance. Users do not have an indication of how progress is made (is it through achievements or some other way) and the use of a linear gradient makes it so that the actual percentage is not exactly properly indicated on the progress bar itself. I think that the icons such as the recording icon could use a label so that people understand what it is for and that the music sheet could use much more work. 

## Conclusion

The design process of this project was a journey and throughout, I learned so many different things about what it means to design for the user experience. I think one important lesson that spoke with me was the **narrowing down of ideas**. In the beginning, I started with a broad concept but overtime, I managed to narrow down that broad concept into something more palatable that I could use as the basis for my design. For example, all I knew in the beginning was that I wanted to create an application for music learning. Then, I started to think more about the websites that I had seen, the users that I wanted to design for, and I narrowed that down to the concept of an application for learning music theory that was engaging and rewarding. Then I went from a mainstream user to an actual persona. I thought about a day in the week and how that particular persona would use my application and it allowed me to single out features that I wanted to prototype out and show. By continuing to hone in on what was important in the design process, I was able to make faster evaluations and changes to improve on my design. I wish I had more time to learn different protoyping techniques to create an even more complete prototype.
