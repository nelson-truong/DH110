## Low Fidelity Prototype

The goal behind this project is to design an application or website that makes learning music theory as seamless as possible. By making learning engaging and giving users a sense of progress, this project will help build a foundation of music theory upon which users can branch off and pursue different musical aspirations. This low fidelity prototype is meant to encapsulate the core features of this project and garner feedback for how to continue designing for the user experience. Having done some user research and crafted personas, this prototype is targeted towards users ranging from young teens to middle aged adults that are still finding their passion for music with no real music background at all. The target user might have some form of interest in music but are not as serious about it as a professional musician might be. The target user is looking for a fun and rewarding experience, somethign that will encourage them to continue pursuing music as a either a hobby or a career.
