## Low Fidelity Prototype

The goal behind this project is to design an application or website that makes learning music theory as seamless as possible. By making learning engaging and giving users a sense of progress, this project will help build a foundation of music theory upon which users can branch off and pursue different musical aspirations. This low fidelity prototype is meant to encapsulate the core features of this project and garner feedback for how to continue designing for the user experience. Having done some user research and crafted personas, this prototype is targeted towards users ranging from young teens to middle aged adults that are still finding their passion for music with no real music background at all. The target user might have some form of interest in music but are not as serious about it as a professional musician might be. The target user is looking for a fun and rewarding experience, somethign that will encourage them to continue pursuing music as a either a hobby or a career.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Checking learning progress

The user thought that it was confusing and didn't like that they had to click on the profile button to check their progress. The user didn't get to the achievements section either.

#### Task 2: Learning about a musical concept

The user thought this was simple and not hard to do at all.

#### Task 3: Picking a reference song

The user thought this was simple and not hard to do at all.

### Reflection

Creating a low fidelity prototype was interesting but frustrating at the same time. I felt this need to make it better and more refined but because it was supposed to be low fidelity, I had to keep those urges contained. Instead, it made me think about what I wanted a user to see in its rawest form. I couldn't make it fancy or extravagant, so the information or features that I wanted to show had to be enough on their own. I think that a low fidelity prototype that is good says a lot about where your project is headed but at the same time, even if its bad, you won't feel as hurt because it was low fidelity. You can just quickly revise it and ensure that your project is headed in the proper direction. 

If I were to revise my low fidelity prototype, I would somehow add a progress bar to the homepage. I want to avoid making users have to navigate multiple pages to get to where they want. I think the information that they need should be in some sort of form on the homepage but I need to think about how to present that in a clear and concise form factor.
