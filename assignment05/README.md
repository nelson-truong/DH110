## Low Fidelity Prototype

The goal behind this project is to design an application or website that makes learning music theory as seamless as possible. By making learning engaging and giving users a sense of progress, this project will help build a foundation of music theory upon which users can branch off and pursue different musical aspirations. This low fidelity prototype is meant to encapsulate the core features of this project and garner feedback for how to continue designing for the user experience.
