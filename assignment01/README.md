# Project Name: Music Theory For Beginners

**Name: Nelson Truong**<br>
**Course: DH110**<br>

## Project Description: 

I want to create an engaging website where anyone can learn music theory for free. This might include learning how to read sheet music, understanding time signatures, and learning different kinds of chords. I hope that once someone is done going through my website, they will have the foundation they need to learn an instrument and play their own song.<br>

## Website Analysis:

### Teoria

Teoria is a website that helps people study and practice music theory through interactive exercises and videos. Information from scales to chords can be found with various tutorials. Overall, I think that Teoria is a very clean website that contains a ton of information. The tutorials help breakdown all of that information into easily digestible tidbits that is helpful for people that are new to music.

#### Heuristic Evaluation

##### Visibility of System Status

**Severity Rating: 1**<br>
Teoria does the bare minimum when relaying system status to their users. Users can choose to start with music theory tutorials, music theory exercises, music theory reference, or articles and Teoria helps users navigate through those different sections of their website. However, if a user wants to backtrack, its hard to know exactly how to get back to the previous spot, unless they understood the icons or slightly colored text, but those indicators are not very distinct. I think this could be improved upon but it is not a major issue.

##### Match between system and the real world

**Severity Rating: 1**<br>
For someone new to music, Teoria is not the friendliest when it comes to musical jargon. It helps explain that jargon through their tutorials but there is no relation between musical terms and what someone might intuitively understand about music. For example, it would be nice if there was the use of audio to relate what a scale is without just an image of a scale on sheet music. People might be able to relate the sound of a scale because they might have heard it before, but more often that not, someone new to music theory has never seen a scale through sheet music. 

##### User control and freedom

**Severity Rating: 1**<br>
This is related to what I mentioned about system status, but Teoria has a lack of clear indicators for navigating **backwards** through their website. In the case of their music theory reference, there is no going back from one music theory term to the next. Teoria expects their users to know exactly what they want and to make no mistakes. However, this is not the most severe issue because navigating from the very beginning to what you want doesn't take very long with how segmented the website is.

##### Consistency and standards

**Severity Rating: 0**<br>
As far as I can tell Teoria follows standards whether it comes to websites or music theory.

##### Error prevention

**Severity Rating: 1**<br>
This is related to previous heuristics but Teoria does not support undo as well as it could be. This is a form of error prevention that could be improved upon and should be improved upon.

##### Recognition rather than recall

**Severity Rating: 1**<br>
Teoria could use more distinct indicators with a better flow. Since it does not support undo well, you have to remember how you got to where you were and navigate the site from the very beginning. This does not help the natural short-term memory that humans have. 

##### Flexibility and efficiency of use

**Severity Rating: 0**<br>
Teoria is extremely efficient with its minimalistic design and in turn is inherently flexible. It does not force people to learn in a certain way, users can choose exactly what they want to learn and pick out certain topics in music theory.

##### Aesthetic and minimalist design

**Severity Rating: 0**<br>
Teoria's design fits its purpose really well. Its design is meant to be minimalistic so that it doesn't detract from the important information which is music theory itself. The lessons are at the forefront and is never cluttered or covered up by anything trivial.

##### Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

**Severity Rating: 0**<br>
I haven't experienced any errors with Teoria yet so its hard to provide a fair evaluation of this heuristic.

##### Help and documentation

**Severity Rating: 0**<br>
Teoria has a help section that goes over anything that people might need help with from providing information about the website itself to setting up an account.
