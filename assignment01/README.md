# Project Name: Music Theory For Beginners

**Name: Nelson Truong**<br>
**Course: DH110**<br>

## Project Description: 

I want to create an engaging website where anyone can learn music theory for free. This might include learning how to read sheet music, understanding time signatures, and learning different kinds of chords. I hope that once someone is done going through my website, they will have the foundation they need to learn an instrument and play their own song.<br>
