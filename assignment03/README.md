# Step 1: Specify the research goal and requirements

The main activity that this project would support for users is the learning of music theory in a seamless way. Users need **confidence** and **determination** if they want to learn music theory. As long as someone is willing and believes that they are capable of doing it then they will be able to learn music theory. Education in the form of classes and websites are able to increase confidence by lowering the difficulty of the first few lessons. However, mainstream music that people listen to on a daily basis is never extremely basic. It would be hard for someone lacking in determination to become interested if they only learn through sounds that they are unfamiliar with. That is why the design challenge is how do we teach music theory to anybody in a way that is engaging and familiar to them.

# Step 2: Target users

The target user can range anywhere from a little kid to an elderly individual, it only depends on if they are beginners to music theory and want to learn more. There is no target age, ethnicity, or background that matters in this context. However, the mainstream user would be a middle aged adult, someone who never learned an instrument or took choir when they were a child. They are more likely to engage with a project like this because they have no prior experience and would benefit from the freedom of not having to take rigid courses like they were when they still had school. The mainstream user might just want to hop on the website after a long day at work and destress, or spend some extra time on their day off. They need to be able to dip in and out without feeling reprecussions. The website would combine visual and audio cues along with music that the user is used to listening to (maybe from their Spotify). An extreme user might be a little child because they are quick to learn and might benefit more from the rigid style of class lessons rather than this kind of project.

# Step 3: Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods) 

This research will involve overt observation and participatory interaction from the individuals that are being interviewed. They will know that we are watching them as they perform their activities and also they will be answering questions and performing certain activities when we ask them to.

# Step 4: Plan the details

The plan is to meet virtually over Zoom because of COVID and scheduling. The activities that we are observing allow for us to do this such as how would you learn to sing a certain song or play a certain instrument. The users will take questions and be prompted to do these activities while data is collected through video and notes.

# Script

This was less of a script and more of a general outline. There were things that we wanted to address with the user but it just felt better to go freeform and listen to what the user was telling us. This will be more visible from the transcript and video recording of the contextual inquiry.

# Reflection

This was so much more insightful and hands on than both the heuristic evaluation and usability test. Being able to pick someone's brain about how they learn music was so interesting. A lot of the user talked about was able to confirm previous suspicions and highlight new issues. Learning music requires dedication and interest because it is very difficult. However, this user also seems to learn music because of the songs that they like to listen to so it becomes easier to continue that grind. The way that the user went about learning music was also very fluid with no structure at all. They would listen to a song a lot of times and then they would start to learn by playing. The whole process is organic, there are no lesson plan or agenda that they adhere to. Overall, this was an amazing contextual inquiry.
