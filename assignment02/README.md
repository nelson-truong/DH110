# DH110: Assignment 2 / Usability Testing

## Why are we doing this usability test?

The website that I am performing the usability test on is musictheory.net. After having performed my own heuristic evaluation of musictheory.net, I want to understand how to improve on some of the problems that this website has. This usability test can also help identify some problems with the website that I had not considered before. The problems that I am going to target with this usability test are with how much information that the website provides and the help that it provides to users. This usability test will be looking at how users interact with each part of the website, the lessons, the tools, and the exercises. The user will go through each a lesson, an exercise, and attempt to use a tool and through this, I want to understand how the website succeeds and fails to provide adequate information that any new user can start learning music theory. When doing my heuristic evaluation, I realized that this website was extremely minimalistic and efficient, except that would only be true for an experienced user. There was practically no readily help provided without having to scour the whole website.

## Reflections on pilot UT

This pilot UT was extremely helpful because so many issues were brought up that I had not noticed before. A lot of issues that I originally thought would be a problem (lack of help from the website, lack of information from the website) did come up but not in the ways that I thought they would. I realized that the minimalistic design was problematic because the icons did not convey what use they had. Since every page had the little gear in the top right, users would be confused at first what that gear is really for. Users wouldn't know that the gear contains options that are specific to whatever exercise or lesson that they are on. That means the website needs to make specific features for each exercise and lesson. That includes combining lessons and exercises so that they can build on top of each other. The text on each lesson also proved to be counter-intuitive because music theory is an auditory and visual experience. The images of the notes and the sound of the note is what helps users learn. Although the usability test went so well and I learned a lot, I also failed to create a coherent script and form. There were typos in the script and I think the tasks could have been better designed so that I could learn more about what the website really needed.
