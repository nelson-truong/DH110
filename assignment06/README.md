## Interface Design

The idea behind this project is to create an application that teaches music theory concepts that is both visually and audibly engaging by allowing them to interact with music they know and love. To keep users motivated and interested, this application will also provide recording capabilities as well as tracking user progress through their own customizable profile.

### Purpose

The purpose of this interface design is to digitize the previous low fidelity prototype. The process of creating this interface design involved Figma and their plugins such as Icons8 (icons) and Stark (color contrast checker).
